## Project Motivation

This project is to understand the key factors that are impacting availability and pricing in the Boston Airbnb Market.
Business Questions:
1. Does traveling season (Apr., Jul., and Dec.) impact listings' availability?
2. Is there any correlation between price and property's listing details (beds, etc)?
3. Can we create a prediction model for listing price in Seattle Area using the listing details analyzed in question 2?
